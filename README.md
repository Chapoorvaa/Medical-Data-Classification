AIML-Project 2024: Medical Data Classification
Project Overview:

The aim of this project is to apply clustering and classification techniques to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using only the NumPy library. The project is divided into three key tasks:

    - K-Means Clustering
    - Classification
    - Distance to Centroids Representation for Classification

The goal is to assess the performance of the models through appropriate metrics like the silhouette score for clustering, and precision, recall, and F1-score for classification.

The final submission must be a Python file (models.py) containing the requested classes, which will be invoked by a training script provided at the end of this document.

Key Instructions:

    You are required to implement clustering using the K-Means algorithm and classification using an algorithm of your choice.
    The entire implementation must be done using only NumPy (no external libraries allowed).
    The dataset will be evaluated on pre-defined tests (listed below).

Dataset:

The dataset to be used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI repository: https ://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic
