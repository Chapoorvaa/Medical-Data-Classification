## AIML-Project 2024: Medical Data Classification

### Project Overview

This project involves applying clustering and classification techniques to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using only the NumPy library. The tasks are:

1. **K-Means Clustering**
2. **Classification**
3. **Distance to Centroids Representation for Classification**

The aim is to evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics like the silhouette score for clustering and precision, recall, and F1-score for classification.

### Key Instructions

- Implement clustering using the K-Means algorithm.
- Implement classification using an algorithm of your choice.
- All implementation must use only the NumPy library (no external libraries allowed).
- The final submission must be a Python file (`models.py`) containing the required classes, which will be invoked by a provided training script.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **K-Means Clustering**: Silhouette Score
- **Classification**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, available from the UCI repository:
